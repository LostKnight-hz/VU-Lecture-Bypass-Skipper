**“Auto-skip VU LMS lectures. Study smart, not longer.”**

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)
![Built For](https://img.shields.io/badge/VU-LMS-blueviolet)

A lightweight browser extension that **automatically marks VU LMS video lectures as watched** and skips to the next one — no timers, no waiting.

🎓 Built for working students, part-time learners, and anyone who values their time.

> Virtual University is designed for self-paced learning — yet students are forced to sit through long videos just to satisfy a timer.  
> This extension is for those who study on their own time — after work, during breaks, or whenever it suits them — and don’t want to waste hours just letting videos play.

## ✅ How It Works

- Open any **VULMS lecture tab**
- The extension **marks the lecture as watched**
- It **automatically switches to the next lecture tab**
- You don’t even need to interact with it — **install once and forget it**

🧠 Focus on learning, not watching timers tick.
